    <h1>Swedish Meatballs (Svenska Kottbullar)</h1>
    <p>This Swedish meatball recipe is our family's Christmas tradition. We frequently double the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker. Worth the effort, and the meatballs are even better the next day! Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the leftovers.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices day-old white bread, crumbled</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground ginger (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. Allow to stand until crumbs absorb cream, about 10 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Step 5 </h3>
            <p>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoon meat mixture per meatball; form into balls. Place meatballs into the skillet and cook, turning often, until browned, about 5 minutes. Insides of meatballs will still be pink.</p>
