    <h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h2>
        <p>"Everyone loved them!" raves Dining Diva. "I used cherrywood ham, cheddar cheese, and everything bagel topping instead of just poppy seeds. Followed the advice of covering with foil half of the cooking time."</p>
        <p>"Very tasty and easy to make," says Allstar SunnyDaysNora. "I left out the poppy seeds as I realized too late that I was out. I used Swiss cheese as written on half of the sandwiches and American cheese on the other for my daughter. Definitely a keeper!"</p>
        <p>"Wish I could give this 10 stars," shares home cook Macy. "These are off the chart good. Wonderful eaten hot or cold. Couldn't stop eating these things."</p>
